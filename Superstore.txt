I am making a Superstore Sales Dashboard in Excel.
These are the questions which I want to address:
1) What are the total sales by segment in each/all years?
2) What are the total sale, quantity, discount and profit in each/all years?
3) What are the profit sales in different regions in each/all years?
4) What is the total quantity in different/all categories in each/all years?
5) What is total sales in different/all categories in each/all years?
6) What is the total profit in different/all categories in each/all years?
7) What is the sum of ship mode in terms of sales in each/all years?
8) What is the sum of ship mode in terms of quantity in each/all years?
9) What is the progress in sales profit and quantity in each month or quarter of different years?
10) What is the profit sales of each year?

The columns are (Row ID, Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit)
Give me each and every step for which column name to choose for rows, filters, values or columns.
For every question appropriate graphs and how to obtain those graphs step by step.
At the end important Slicers with the dashboard name and a nice decent wireframe for the dashboard.
