Questions:-
Q1. Get the Unique Start and Stop Location?
Q2. Get the Total number of Unique Start and Stop Locations.
Answer: We add Start* and Stop* to pivot rows individually and calculate their counts using COUNTA function.
 
Q3. What are the most famous Start and drop locations?
Answer:-  We add Start* and Stop* to pivot rows and sum of sales to pivot values.

Q4. The most frequent route taken.
Q5. Highest Route speed.

All the "*" columns were already present in the dataset. Rest were generated manually.
i. For the last question, we need to see variuos factors w.r.t. speed (overspeeding), i.e. we need to calculate time from Start_Date*. So a new column is generated i.e. Start_Time.
We also calculated End_Time, Start_Date, End_Date column. 
For the Start_Time and End_Time:- We need to select the primary column --> goto data tab --> under data tools --> text to columns --> fixed_width --> next --> date to (mdy) --> Finish.

ii. After finding the Start_Time and End_Time, I calculated Time in minutes by subtracting End_Time with Start_Time and multiplying the whole with 24 and 60.
And then calculated Time in hours by dividing the Time(mins) by 60.
***Over here, the issue generated was what if the ride on one day and ended on the next day. Generating negative time period too; and indeed a negative speed.***
To overcome this we need to change the time period from 24 hours to 12 hours for the Start_Time and the End_Time respectively.
Select the Start_Time column --> under numbers --> more number formats --> Time --> 01:30:55PM (for the am/pm format) -->

Again re-writing the time mins condition with the help of if statement as we have am/pm now.
The formula is : "=if(F2>C2,F2-C2,F2-C2+1)" for TIME Diff.
Convert it into Time Again in 
For calculating it in hours: "=(hour(H2)*60+minute(H2))/60"
Convert it into general again.

Now everything is in +ve format including Speed. 
However there's an anomaly that at some places the Start_Time and End_Time is the same. Its an error. Total 4 rows are like that. Deleting those.
After checking the Speed column there are speed which are above 120 which are improper. This is because the time and the distance travelled isn't showing a clear picture.
The highest was 906,664,552.
I check calculating outliers but the output is not feasible to use as its to less.
Max Speed which I have taken is of 141.

***Now my Data Cleaning and Data Transformation everything is done.***
